Dr RRRRRRR,
I'm writing you asking for guidance as both a long time family friend, and trusted advisor on the health, 
and well being of our son XXX YYY. I appreciate your time, attention, and understanding on this matter.

As you know XXX has had to travel a complicated path in order to achieve the current successes in his life. 
As his parents, both Sarah and I would like to continue to provide XXX with all the tools he needs to navigate 
this difficult path moving forward. We've come to a new crossroad as he grows and matures, one that has required 
us to explore various options.  

XXX is in constant struggle to control his behavior, thoughts, and at times his own actions. We have tried a several 
traditional therapeutic, and pharmaceutical routes to help adjust, mitigate, or accommodate XXX's behavior fluctuations. 
These attempts include but are not limited to: Behavior Therapy, Equine Therapy, Refusal plans in his IEP, Special 
Olympics Activities, Wilbarger Brushing Protocol, a sensory diet, and other suggestions from Franklin County special 
needs staff. Most recently we have placed XXX on an extended wait list for a potential service dog in the future. 

In the past year we have also attempted different forms of medication with varying degrees of success, and failure in 
each instance. Due to the complexity of his brain abnormalities, and his inherent inability to process emotions 
efficiently, XXX can at times suffer from being anxious, impulsive, inattentive, argumentative, disruptive, hyperactive, 
and short tempered. 

Our son is also unfortunately seemingly prone to experiencing commonly known side effects in the available prescription 
drug options. Some of the side effects can amplify existing symptoms, making them worse during specific times within the 
medicines effective usage window, or half-life. Paxil, Zoloft, Clonidine, and Guanfacine have all been trialed as 
solutions for XXX's current behavior, and emotional needs. Of the previously mentioned options, none has been shown to 
provide enough coverage for his varying behavioral ailments to be effective alone. In particular Paxil, Zoloft, and 
Clonidine side effects were so severe we as a family were unable to actualize any benefit, and immediately stopped usage. 

Long term Guanfacine release as opposed to short term release seems to be beneficial to XXX. We have noticed that XXX is
hit hard with non desirable effects during times of dosage troughs, specifically at the half-life, and remaining quarter
increments. When the medication is near the end of its effective use time frame, XXX can experience exaggeration of the 
exact symptoms we are seeking to medicate him for. The end result can be a hard crash before bed time rife with anxiety, 
anger, and even a "down" feeling (which is a seemingly new feeling). 

On the inverse if timing, or conditions are just right he may stay up too long, or past some dose trough, and subsequently
get hit with a dose crest. The initial onset in the first 1-4 hours can be intense for XXX if he has not been able to make 
it to sleep. Once the meds start to take hold his brain often goes into over drive. He on several occasions voiced that 
he feels like he needs to go down to his toy room to "build something", or "paint" while he "stays up all night". These 
dose troughs, and crests often quite simply come at very inconvenient times for XXX, such as just before bed time, or right 
before dinner during post work interactions, or other transition times with his parents. Being flooded with random emotions 
at either end of a dose is often described by XXX as being "overwhelming". The short term release variant of Guanfacine 
seemed to perpetuate this cycle into something much more unmanageable. 

The side effects that XXX experiences at semi-random, but often predictable increments include: dizziness, headaches, 
racing heart that "feels broken”, or “hurts", lower back pain, fatigue, random uncontrollable rage, random more-controllable 
less-severe anger, increased agitation, and shortness, inability to cope with unexpected change, general anxiety, "busy thoughts", 
"daydreaming", exaggerated memory loss, heat sensitivity, dehydration sensitivity, decreased general appetite, and increased
appetite during dose troughs. Many of the things already documented by the FDA post market report. And prescribing guidelines, 
are things that XXX experiences.

The benefits of long term Guanfacine release seem to smooth XXX out over all and make for what we consider to be a 
desirable effect that seems to outweigh the side effect frequency. The benefits unfortunately do not make any of the side 
effects less concerning. At the very least for XXX's father there is a lingering concern that increased dosages could exacerbate, 
or further trigger yet to be observed side effects. We as a family are indeed open to trying different dose permutations, 
but we would also like to have something on hand to try and provide XXX some relief during the times that the medication is 
unable to cut through existing anxiety, or other tense moments in which side effects may start to compound existing symptoms. 

Over all the benefits of Guanfacine do indeed outweigh the side effects that XXX is experiencing. None the less it would 
similarly be comforting to have a back up plan on hand in the event that we are unable to fill his prescription in the future, 
or in the event he misses a dose and needs to make it through the following day. Even having the ability to provide momentary,
fast acting, short term effect adjustments to XXX's environment via alternative medication will be beneficial to prevent 
spiraling meltdowns during dose troughs, or crests. 

XXX's general symptoms are not at all surprising considering his prognosis regarding his Holoprosencephaly, and related brain 
abnormalities. Many of the things he experiences are par for the course. In searching for potential options for XXX, medical 
Cannabis has been hard to ignore. There is an increasing sample size of people with similar ailments that are finding some 
relief through medicinal cannabinoids. Specifically recent pediatric cannabinoid use studies in autistic patients out of 
Israel seem directly applicable to some of XXX's ailments. 

The primary goal of the information that follows is to seek any concerns that you may have as XXX's Pediatrician, and 
secondarily to help us as a family sort out a systematic approach to dosage, and measurement of effectiveness with regard 
to XXX using medical Cannabis in various forms. We are specifically evaluating high CBD, low THC ratio delivery techniques, 
and dose methods. The most likely approach will be via High CBD content edible, and ingestible Cannabis products. 

Per Ohio Revised Code section 3719.01 XXX qualifies as eligible for the Ohio Medical Marijuana Control Program due to his 
"seizure disorder". http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/3796

XXX is now accordingly registered with the Ohio Pharmacy board as a Medical Marijuana patient per ORC 3796.08. 
http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/3796.08v1

As XXX's parents, both of us have subsequently qualified for caregiver status, passed the state background checks, and 
obtained cards to be XXX's caregiver under the Ohio Medical Marijuana Control Program. Per guidelines in ORC 3796 we can 
now purchase, possess, and administer Cannabis to XXX, legally per the state of Ohio Pharmacy Board, and applicable Ohio 
Revised Code.

Beyond our own research, and reading of the scientific documents, papers, and publications linked below, we have additionally 
been informing ourselves via social media groups for parents in similar positions. In many cases parents are using pharmaceutical 
CBD in combination with Intuniv, or as a means to wean off of it or similar pharmaceuticals. Specifically we are participating in the
"Whole Plant Access For Autism Support Group" on Facebook. The group currently has approximately 25,551 members in attendance
 on Facebook. https://www.facebook.com/groups/561238844053005/. The website for the non-profit group is located at: https://wpa4a.org

In addition to reaching out to you, we have also touched base with XXX's new psychiatrist from Children's hospital. Apart from a
self-admitted lack of knowledge on the topic, her main concern was with: "High-potency cannabis", and potential "psychosis". Her
concern in my opinion likely comes from the following studies: 
High-potency cannabis and the risk of psychosis 
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2801827/ 
Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol: harmful even in low doses?
https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(20)30093-6/fulltext  
Cannabis and psychosis: Neurobiology 
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3927252/. 

It should be noted that high CBD strains that we are seeking for XXX to use are not akin to "high-potency [THC]" forms of Cannabis 
referenced by many of the studies on this topic. 

It is also worth pointing out that Guanfacine, the drug that XXX is currently prescribed is also associated with psychosis. 
The unfortunate reality is that several of the pharmaceutical options available to XXX, are also at times known to trigger, increase probability
for, or at the very least have correlation with psychosis. It was noted very poignantly in one of the three papers above: "In some people, 
Cannabis leads to incident psychosis, whereas in other people, psychosis leads to incident Cannabis use". There will undoubtedly be short 
and long term risks with any medication route we take, these concerns are not limited to Cannabis. 

XXX has had a long term behavioral therapist, whom is also supportive of our choice to potentially head down this path. The hope for her 
was that Cannabis could help provide additional coverage for XXX in times of need such as transition periods, periods of difficult change, 
at night when he has trouble sleeping, and other situations in which he is unable to control his emotions, or thoughts. These specific use 
cases for Cannabis could occur randomly, or be predicted based on known situational triggers, and times of peak anxiety for XXX. 

Finally we have spoken to Dr. LLLLLLL MMMMM, the Medical Director for an Ohio Medical Marijuana Program patient registration group. After 
reviewing XXX's records, and discussing his case with us as a family, he approved XXX for the program. The approval was based on XXX's brain 
abnormalities leaving him prone to seizures. The discussion helped highlight that XXX's behavioral issues could potentially be a form of 
emotional seizure, and as such CBD may be something to help mitigate XXX's symptoms.

The below information represents many of the studies and documents that we have read to help guide our decision to attempt to 
use pharmaceutical grade CBD from the Ohio Medical Marijuana Control Project for XXX.

Once again, we as a family appreciate your guidance, concerns, and support. Ultimately we are just looking for ways to help XXX 
overcome his struggles and live the most independent and happiest life that he can. We hope that you can help us determine the 
proper approach to introducing Cannabis / CBD to XXX's list of tools that help him navigate the world. 

Thank you again for your time. The YYY Family.
